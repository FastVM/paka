# Paka & Purr

Paka is a language designed to be everything that I want in a language.
The default compiler for this language is called Purr, it targets MiniVM.

## Examples

## Development

Paka and Purr are developed mainly by [Shaw Summa](#shaw-summa).

All contributions are greatly welcome, from performance improvments, to doccumentation.

### What needs work

Paka is evolving rapidly, it needs work in:
- Tooling
  - Highlighers
  - Debuggers
  - Compiler messages
- Ideas
  - Remove features that are not used or slow
  - Change things to be simpler
  - Add new features without minivm modifications
- Replace println with putchar
